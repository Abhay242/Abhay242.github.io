## About Me

I am a Research Associate working at SPIRE Lab at IISC Bengaluru, India under the supervision of Dr. Prasanta Kumar Ghosh. Graduted from NIT Srinagar in Computer Science & Engineering. At SPIRE lab I am working problems related to Audio-Visual Speech Synthesis, Accent Conversion and Developing TTS & ASR systems for multiple Indian languages. During my under-graduate studies I have worked on projects mainly related to Computer Vision and NLP.
Inquistive towards the field of Machine Learning and its unnumerable real-world applications.
